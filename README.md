TO DO:

- [ ] Add and Update specs (Need to create user with password and sign in user otherwise specs fail at validation)
- [ ] Link signup, login/logout and root page together for seemless experience
- [ ] Add consistent design for each page with headers/menu
- [ ] Set up phone input to be similar to twilio where there is a country code drop down
- [ ] Do Research on other phone methods mentioned ( bandwidth, Plivo, Nexmo). Wonder if there is a way to accept current user phone as FROM and allow user to input TO phone number

* System dependencies
